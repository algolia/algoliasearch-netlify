# Contributing

## Development

```sh
yarn dev
```

Launches all 3 dev tools:
- [plugin](./plugin)
- [frontend library](./frontend)
- and [test website](./public)

See each tool's respective README.

## Releasing

```sh
yarn release
```

This releases both `plugin` & `frontend` to be sure our versions are aligned even if there was changes in only one of both projects.
