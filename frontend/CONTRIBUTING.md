## Scripts

- `yarn dev`: run dev environment
- `yarn release`: build & publish the library

## Development

From this folder:

```sh
yarn dev
```

Or from the root of the repository:

```sh
yarn dev:frontend
```

This runs a `webpack-dev-server` on port 9100.
Meant to be used in conjunction with the [test website](../public/).
