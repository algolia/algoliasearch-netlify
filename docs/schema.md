# Extracted Record Schema

Algolia is a schema-less search engine. However to provide a simple and easy experience with Neltify and the Crawler,
we currently populate Algolia with a standard record.

All root level properties are a computation of multiple selectors with fallback. We **might change the extraction logic** or to add more properties, but **will not remove root level properties without a proper deprecation period**.
All properties marked as "not undefined" will be present in the end record, the other can be missing if did not find any relevant information.

## Schema

```ts
{
  /**
   * The Algolia unique identifier
   */
  objectID: string;

  /**
   * Where did we found this record
   */
  url: string;

   * The lang of the page.
   * - html[attr=lang]

  lang?: string;

  /**

  title?: string;
  
  /**
   * The description of the page.
   * - meta[name=description]
   * - meta[property="og:description"]

  urlDepth?: number;

  /**
   * The content of your page.

  content: string;

  /**********************************************

## Record spliting

For better relevancy, record can be split in multiple records.
We create all indices with the index settings `{ distinct: true, attributeForDistinct: 'url' }` to deduplicate at search time.
